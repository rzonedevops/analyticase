### 2.3 Resource Utilization

Resource utilization analysis reveals bottlenecks and optimization opportunities:

| Resource Type | Average Utilization | Peak Utilization |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Judges | 76.74% | 95%+ |
| Attorneys | 54.45% | 80%+ |
| Courtrooms | 25.58% | 60% |

**Key Observations:**

2. **Attorney Capacity:** Moderate utilization (54.45%) suggests attorneys have capacity for additional cases, though distribution may be uneven.

3. **Courtroom Underutilization:** Low utilization (25.58%) indicates courtrooms are not the limiting factor. This resource could potentially be reduced or reallocated.

### 2.4 Legal Principle Invocation Analysis

The simulation tracked principle invocations throughout the case lifecycle:

#### Principle Invocation Frequency

| Principle | Invocations | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| nemo-iudex-in-causa-sua | 17 | 12.1% |
| damnum-injuria-datum | 15 | 10.7% |
| audi-alteram-partem | 14 | 10.0% |

| causation | 9 | 6.4% |
| nemo-plus-iuris | 9 | 6.4% |
| rule-of-law | 8 | 5.7% |
| consensus-ad-idem | 7 | 5.0% |
| nullum-crimen-sine-lege | 5 | 3.6% |

**Analysis:**

- **Administrative Law Principles** (audi-alteram-partem, nemo-iudex-in-causa-sua) were most frequently invoked, reflecting the prevalence of procedural fairness considerations.

- **Delict Principles** (damnum-injuria-datum, culpa, causation) showed high invocation rates, indicating significant tort law activity.

- **Contract Principles** (pacta-sunt-servanda, consensus-ad-idem, bona-fides) were moderately invoked, consistent with the case type distribution.

### 2.5 Settlement Analysis

Settlement negotiations occurred in approximately 40% of contract and civil cases:

- **Settlement Attempts:** 40 cases
- **Successful Settlements:** 3 cases
- **Settlement Success Rate:** 7.5%
- **Average Settlement Amount:** R450,000

**Factors Affecting Settlement:**

1. **Case Complexity:** Lower complexity cases (3-5) had higher settlement rates (12%) compared to complex cases (8-10) at 4%.

2. **Timing:** Settlements attempted earlier in the case lifecycle (pre-trial stage) had higher success rates.

3. **Case Type:** Contract and delict cases showed higher settlement propensity than criminal or constitutional cases.

### 2.6 Process Mining Insights

Analysis of case event sequences revealed common process variants:

#### Top 5 Process Variants

1. **Standard Processing (65% of cases):**
   - case_filed → evidence_submitted → discovery_completed → hearing_scheduled → hearing_conducted → ruling_issued → case_closed

2. **Settlement Path (3% of cases):**
   - case_filed → evidence_submitted → settlement_negotiation → settlement_reached → case_closed

3. **Extended Discovery (20% of cases):**
   - case_filed → evidence_submitted → discovery_completed → document_filed → hearing_scheduled → hearing_conducted → ruling_issued → case_closed

4. **Multiple Hearings (8% of cases):**
   - case_filed → evidence_submitted → discovery_completed → hearing_scheduled → hearing_conducted → hearing_scheduled → hearing_conducted → ruling_issued → case_closed

5. **Expedited Processing (4% of cases):**
   - case_filed → evidence_submitted → hearing_scheduled → hearing_conducted → ruling_issued → case_closed

### 2.7 Bottleneck Identification

Process mining analysis identified key bottlenecks:

1. **Hearing Scheduling:** Average wait time of 10-30 days due to judge and courtroom availability constraints.

2. **Discovery Phase:** Extended discovery periods (20-60 days) in complex cases contributed significantly to overall case duration.

3. **Ruling Issuance:** Post-hearing ruling delays (5-20 days) suggest opportunity for process improvement.

## 3. HyperGNN Model Results

### 3.1 Hypergraph Structure

The enhanced HyperGNN model established a foundational legal knowledge hypergraph:

#### Hypergraph Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Nodes | 3 |
| Total Hyperedges | 1 |
| Average Node Degree | 1.0 |
| Maximum Node Degree | 1 |
| Average Hyperedge Size | 3.0 |
| Maximum Hyperedge Size | 3 |

#### Node Type Distribution

| Node Type | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Principle | 2 |
| Case | 1 |
| Statute | 0 |
| Party | 0 |
| Judge | 0 |
| Attorney | 0 |
| Evidence | 0 |
| Precedent | 0 |

#### Hyperedge Type Distribution

| Hyperedge Type | Count |
|----------------|-------|
| Applies | 1 |
| Cites | 0 |
| Conflicts | 0 |
| Others | 0 |

### 3.2 Model Architecture

The enhanced HyperGNN employs:

- **Layers:** 3 layers (input: 64 → hidden: 32 → hidden: 32)
- **Attention Heads:** 4 multi-head attention mechanisms
- **Edge Type Specific Weights:** 10 different edge types with dedicated transformation matrices
- **Hierarchical Attention:** Principle → Statute → Case hierarchy

### 3.3 Node Importance Analysis

Node importance scores based on centrality and embedding magnitude:

|---------|-----------|------------------|
| case_001 | Case | 0.1668 |
| principle_pacta_sunt_servanda | Principle | 0.1668 |
| principle_bona_fides | Principle | 0.1667 |

**Observations:**

- All nodes show similar importance scores due to the small hypergraph size

### 3.4 Case Outcome Prediction

Initial case outcome prediction for case_001:

- **Plaintiff Wins:** 49.99%
- **Defendant Wins:** 50.01%

The near-equal probabilities reflect the limited hypergraph structure. As more nodes, relationships, and training data are added, prediction accuracy is expected to improve significantly.

### 3.5 Conflict Detection

No conflicts detected in the current hypergraph structure. The conflict detection mechanism is designed to identify:

- Contradictory principles within the same legal domain
- Precedents that overrule each other
- Incompatible legal interpretations
