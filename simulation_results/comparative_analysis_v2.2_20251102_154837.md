## Cross-Model Insights

The integration of enhanced legal frameworks (v2.2) across all simulation models demonstrates the value of multi-paradigm analysis in legal systems. Each model provides unique perspectives on case dynamics, principle application, and system performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Legal Framework Integration**: Continue expanding the enumerated Scheme representations with additional jurisdictions and legal domains.

2. **Model Coupling**: Develop tighter integration between models to enable hybrid simulations that leverage strengths of each paradigm.

3. **Validation**: Compare simulation results with real-world judicial data to validate model accuracy and calibrate parameters.

4. **Database Synchronization**: Ensure all enhanced frameworks are synchronized with Supabase and Neon databases for persistent storage and querying.
