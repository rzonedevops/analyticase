## Key Insights from Simulations

### Capacity & Efficiency
The gap between agent-level efficiency (83.7%) and system-level efficiency (93.6%) suggests that system-level coordination can compensate for individual inefficiencies.

### Case Duration Variability
The discrete-event simulation (160 days average) vs. system dynamics (83.9 days average) reveals the importance of using multiple modeling approaches to understand both individual case variability and system-level trends.

### Network Complexity
The HyperGNN analysis demonstrates that legal cases involve complex, higher-order relationships that require advanced network analysis techniques beyond traditional pairwise graphs.

### Predictive Capabilities
The Case-LLM model shows strong predictive capabilities (75% confidence) when provided with quality evidence and legal merit data.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy Database Schemas**: Apply the simulation schema to both Neon and Supabase databases

2. **API Integration**: Expose simulation capabilities via REST API
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement real-time performance metrics tracking
4. **Automated Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Long-term Strategic Goals
