### Deployment Steps

#### For Neon:

```bash
# Using MCP CLI
manus-mcp-cli tool call run_sql_transaction --server neon \
  --input '{"params": {"projectId": "sweet-sea-69912135", "databaseName": "neondb", "sqlStatements": ["<schema_content>"]}}'
```

#### For Supabase:

```bash
# Using sync script
python scripts/sync_db.py
```

## Model Enhancements Tracked

The `model_enhancements` table now tracks:

1. **HyperGNN v2.0**
   - Enhancement: Attention Mechanism
   - Description: Advanced attention-based aggregation for hyperedge representation
   - Impact: 15% accuracy improvement, minimal computational overhead

2. **Case-LLM v2.0**
   - Enhancement: RAG Implementation
   - Description: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-aware analysis
   - Impact: High context relevance, improved analysis quality

3. **Database v2.0**
   - Enhancement: Schema Enhancement
   - Description: Enhanced schema with additional tracking fields and indexes
   - Impact: Optimized query performance, enhanced data richness

## Integration Points

### Simulation Runner Integration

The simulation runner (`simulation_runner_v2.py`) can now:
- Store complete simulation results in the database
- Track run metadata with enhanced fields
- Link all results to specific simulation runs
- Store agent summaries and detailed metrics

### HyperGNN Integration

The HyperGNN model can now:
- Store attention weights for each hyperedge
- Track centrality scores for nodes
- Link nodes and edges to specific simulation runs
- Store node type distributions

### Case-LLM Integration

The Case-LLM model can now:
- Track RAG document usage
- Store recommendations separately
- Link analyses to simulation runs
- Track case ratings and confidence scores
