### 1. Case Summary

On January 15, 2025, the parties entered into a contract requiring the defendant to deliver specified goods by March 1, 2025. The defendant failed to meet this delivery deadline. As a result, the plaintiff alleges financial losses attributable to the defendant’s non-performance. The defendant contends that the failure to deliver was excused under a force majeure clause contained in the contract. The central issues concern whether the defendant breached the contract, the applicability of the force majeure defense, and the appropriate calculation of damages.

### 2. Legal Issues

- Whether the defendant’s failure to deliver by the March 1, 2025 deadline constitutes a breach of contract.
- Whether the defendant is excused from performance under the contract’s force majeure clause.
- The method and extent of damages recoverable by the plaintiff due to the alleged breach.

### 3. Analysis

**Breach of Contract:**  
The contract explicitly required delivery by March 1, 2025. The defendant’s failure to deliver by this date prima facie constitutes a breach. Unless excused, the defendant is liable for damages resulting from the breach.

**Force Majeure Defense:**  
The applicability of the force majeure clause depends on the specific language of the contract and the nature of the event causing non-performance. To successfully invoke this defense, the defendant must demonstrate:

- The occurrence of an unforeseeable, extraordinary event beyond their control.
- That the event directly prevented performance.
- That reasonable efforts were made to mitigate the impact.

If the defendant cannot substantiate these elements, the force majeure defense will likely fail.

**Damages Calculation:**  
Damages aim to place the plaintiff in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. This includes:

- Direct losses such as the cost difference to procure substitute goods.
- Consequential losses directly attributable to the breach, if foreseeable.
  
The plaintiff must provide evidence quantifying these losses. Any mitigation efforts by the plaintiff will also be considered in assessing damages.

### 4. Recommendations

- **Fact-Finding:** Obtain detailed evidence regarding the cause of non-delivery and the defendant’s efforts to perform or mitigate.
- **Contract Review:** Analyze the force majeure clause language to determine scope and applicability.
- **Damages Assessment:** Work with financial experts to quantify the plaintiff’s losses accurately.
- **Negotiation/Mediation:** Consider alternative dispute resolution to achieve a timely settlement.
- **Litigation Preparedness:** If settlement is not feasible, prepare to argue breach and damages while anticipating the defendant’s force majeure defense.
