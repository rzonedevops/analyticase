## Inference Level Hierarchy

The legal framework is organized into inference levels, reflecting the abstraction hierarchy of legal reasoning:

### Level 1: First-Order Principles (`lv1/`)

The foundational layer containing 60+ universally recognized legal maxims and principles:

- **Contract Principles**: pacta-sunt-servanda, consensus-ad-idem
- **Property Principles**: nemo-plus-iuris, nemo-dat-quod-non-habet
- **Procedural Justice**: audi-alteram-partem, nemo-iudex-in-causa-sua
- **Criminal Law**: nullum-crimen-sine-lege, actus-non-facit-reum-nisi-mens-sit-rea
- **Constitutional**: supremacy-of-constitution, rule-of-law, ubuntu
- **And 50+ more fundamental legal principles**

These first-order principles serve as the foundational layer from which all higher-level legal principles are derived through inference. They have confidence = 1.0 (explicitly stated, universally recognized).

**Example derivation**:
```
Level 1: pacta-sunt-servanda + consensus-ad-idem + consideration-exists
    ↓ (Inductive inference)
Level 2: Valid contracts require mutual agreement and consideration
    ↓ (Abductive inference)
Level 3: Contract law promotes certainty and voluntary obligations
```

### Level 2+: Derived Legal Frameworks

The jurisdiction-specific frameworks (`civ/za/`, `cri/za/`, etc.) are derived from Level 1 first-order principles through:

- **Deductive reasoning**: Applying general principles to specific jurisdictions
- **Inductive reasoning**: Generalizing from specific laws to broader principles
- **Abductive reasoning**: Hypothesizing best explanations for legal patterns
- **Analogical reasoning**: Transferring principles across legal domains

See `models/ggmlex/INFERENCE_ENGINE_README.md` for details on the inference models.

## Implementation Features

All frameworks include:
- Rule-based legal reasoning structures
- Precedent system support
- Statutory interpretation rules
- Comprehensive placeholder functions for future implementation
- Extensible architecture for additional legal rules
- Integration with HypergraphQL engine

## Statistics

- **Level 1 First-Order Principles**: 60+ fundamental legal maxims and principles
- **Total Legal Principles**: 823 (across all 8 jurisdiction-specific frameworks)
- **Total Functions**: 800+ placeholder functions ready for implementation
- **Jurisdictions**: South Africa (za) with extensibility for other jurisdictions

## Integration with HypergraphQL

The legal frameworks automatically load into the HypergraphQL engine (see `models/ggmlex/hypergraphql/`), enabling:
- Graph traversal and querying of legal concepts
- Pattern matching over legal structures
- Path finding between legal principles
- Content-based search across all frameworks

## Testing

Run the legal framework integration tests:
```bash
python models/ggmlex/test_legal_frameworks.py
```

## Future Extensions

The framework includes placeholder functions that can be implemented with:
- Specific legal rules and algorithms
- Machine learning models
- Integration with legal databases and APIs
- Natural language processing for legal text
- Case law citation networks
- Statutory interpretation engines

## Usage

This framework provides the foundational structure for implementing:
- Legal reasoning systems
- Expert systems for legal analysis
- Automated legal document analysis
- Case prediction systems
- Compliance checking tools
- Legal education platforms
