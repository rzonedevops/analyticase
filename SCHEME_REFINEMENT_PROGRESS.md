## Previously Completed Frameworks (Before October 2025)

### 1. Civil Law Framework ✅

**Completion Timeline**:
- Construction Law: 4-6 hours
- Environmental Law: 4-6 hours
- International Law: 4-6 hours
- **Total**: 12-18 hours of development

## Technical Architecture

### Hypergraph Structure
The enhanced frameworks create a rich hypergraph where:
- **Nodes** represent legal concepts, principles, tests, and requirements
- **Edges** represent dependencies, relationships, and references
- **Attributes** encode specific values (ages, days, percentages, thresholds)
- **Conditional Logic** enables multi-level legal reasoning

### Integration with GGMLEX
Enhanced frameworks integrate seamlessly with:
- **HypergraphQLEngine**: Loads all .scm files automatically
- **LegalSchema**: Validates node and edge structures
- **Query System**: Content-based search across frameworks
- **Relationship Extraction**: Automatic dependency detection

### Attribute-Based Predicates
All implementations use attribute-based predicates for flexibility:
```scheme
(define has-attribute (lambda (entity attribute)
  (and (not (null? entity))
       (if (pair? entity)
           (or (eq? (car entity) attribute)
               (has-attribute (cdr entity) attribute))
           (eq? entity attribute)))))
```

This allows legal entities to be represented as:
- Atoms: `'pregnant`
- Pairs: `'(age . 18)`
- Lists: `'(employee (age 25) (years-service 3))`

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
All enhancements validated through:
1. **Syntax Validation**: All .scm files parse correctly
2. **Loading Validation**: HypergraphQLEngine loads all frameworks
3. **Node Extraction**: All definitions become nodes
4. **Edge Extraction**: All dependencies become edges
5. **Query Validation**: Content searches return expected results
6. **Statistics Verification**: Node and edge counts match expectations

### Code Quality Standards
Enhancements maintain:
- **Descriptive Naming**: Function names match legal terminology
- **Logical Decomposition**: Complex tests broken into components
- **Functional Composition**: Higher-level functions compose lower-level ones
- **Clear Documentation**: Self-documenting through naming and structure
- **Consistent Style**: Follows established Scheme conventions
