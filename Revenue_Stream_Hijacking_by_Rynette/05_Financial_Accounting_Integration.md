## Internal Controls and Separation of Duties

### Multi-User Access Model

**Roles and Permissions**:

1. **Business Owner/Director**
   - View all financial reports
   - Approve large transactions (e.g., > R 10,000)
   - Cannot post transactions directly
   - Cannot delete transactions
   - Can export reports

2. **Financial Manager/Accountant**
   - Post journal entries
   - Reconcile accounts
   - Prepare financial reports
   - Cannot approve own transactions (if over threshold)
   - Cannot delete audit trail

3. **Bookkeeper**
   - Post routine transactions
   - Reconcile bank accounts
   - Process invoices and payments
   - Limited report access
   - Cannot void/delete transactions without approval

4. **Operations Manager**
   - View P&L and cash flow
   - Cannot post financial transactions
   - Can view inventory and COGS reports

5. **External Auditor** (time-limited access)
   - Read-only access to all financial data
   - Access to audit trail
   - Can export data for audit working papers
   - Cannot post, edit, or delete anything

**Key Principle**: No single person can complete a financial transaction from initiation to approval to posting without oversight.

Amount R 5,000 - R 20,000: Manager approval required
Amount > R 20,000: Director approval required
```

**Journal Entry Approval**:
```
Routine entries: Bookkeeper posts, auto-approved
Non-routine entries: Financial Manager reviews and approves
Large adjustments (> R 10,000): Director approval required
```

Transfer < R 10,000: Single approval (Financial Manager)
Transfer R 10,000 - R 100,000: Two approvals (Manager + Director)
Transfer > R 100,000: Three approvals (Manager + 2 Directors)
```

### Audit Trail

## Contrast with Current Opaque System

### Current System (Rynette's Control)

**Deficiencies**:
1. **No Financial Integration**: Manual entry or no accounting system at all
2. **No Transparency**: Business owners cannot see financial reports
3. **No Audit Trail**: Cannot verify financial transactions
4. **Single Person Control**: Only Rynette has financial access
5. **Manual Processes**: Error-prone, time-consuming
6. **No Reconciliation**: Bank accounts may not be reconciled properly
7. **Tax Risk**: Potential non-compliance with SARS requirements
8. **No Oversight**: No separation of duties or approval workflows
9. **Personal Computer**: Financial data on personal device
10. **Fraud Risk**: No detection mechanisms or cross-checks

**Impact**:
- Business owners operate in financial blindness
- Cannot make informed financial decisions
- Tax compliance questionable
- Audit nightmare (or impossible)
- Potential embezzlement undetectable
- Business valuation compromised
- Legal and regulatory risks

### Proposed Integrated System

**Advantages**:
1. **Automated Integration**: Seamless data flow, no manual entry
2. **Full Transparency**: All stakeholders can access financial reports
3. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every transaction logged and traceable
