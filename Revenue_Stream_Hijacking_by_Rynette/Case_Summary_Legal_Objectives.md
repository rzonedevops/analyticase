# Case Summary and Legal Objectives

## Nature of the Dispute

### The Transparent System (Pre-Hijacking)

For approximately 10 years, the businesses operated on a transparent system with the following characteristics:

**Platform**: Shopify E-Commerce Platform (Enterprise-grade)  
**Domain**: regima.zone (owned by RegimA - legitimate business entity)  
**Access**: Multi-stakeholder with appropriate role-based access  
**Oversight**: Robust oversight mechanisms with cross-checks  
**Compliance**: POPIA-compliant with verifiable audit trails  
**Operations**: Professional, scalable, secure, and transparent

**Key Features**:
1. Clear audit trails for all customer communications
2. Professional email system via regima.zone
3. Secure portals for different stakeholder levels
4. Comprehensive sales trends tracking and reporting
5. Integrated financial accounting with stakeholder visibility
6. Efficient warehouse fulfillment system
7. Multi-carrier courier logistics integration
8. Real-time business intelligence and analytics
