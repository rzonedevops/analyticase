- Purpose specification records (Section 11)
- Enterprise security safeguards (Section 19)

- Email notification audit trail (Section 23)

### 2. Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA)

#### Statutory Basis
**Act**: Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 2002 (Act No. 25 of 2002)

#### Relevant Provisions

**Chapter VII - Consumer Protection**
- Requires transparency in electronic transactions
- Right to information about goods and services
- Current opaque system prevents transparency

**Section 43 - Retention of Electronic Data**
- Electronic communications must be retained for prescribed period
- Audit trail is essential for retention compliance
- Current system may not retain communications properly

**Section 51 - Duty to Protect Personal Information**
- Complements POPIA requirements
- Data collectors must protect personal information
- Personal PC is inadequate protection mechanism

#### Application to Case

The proposed transparent system with regima.zone email infrastructure:
- Retains all electronic communications (audit trail)
- Provides consumer transparency (customer portal)
- Protects personal information (enterprise security)

The current opaque system:
- May not retain communications properly
- Provides no consumer transparency
- Inadequately protects personal information

- Accessible customer information (portal)
- Audit trail for dispute resolution

The current opaque system:
- May lack proper records
- Customer rights difficult or impossible to exercise
- No customer access to information
- No evidence for dispute resolution

### 4. Companies Act

#### Statutory Basis
**Act**: Companies Act, 2008 (Act No. 71 of 2008)

#### Relevant Provisions

**Section 76 - Standards of Directors' Conduct**
- Directors must act in good faith and best interests of company
- Must exercise care, skill and diligence
- Allowing opaque system may breach fiduciary duties

**Section 29 - Accounting Records**

#### Application to Case

Directors/business owners have fiduciary duty to:

- Ensure compliance with legal requirements
- Protect company assets and information
- Maintain proper accounting records

Allowing the opaque system may constitute breach of fiduciary duties.

The transparent system enables directors to fulfill duties:
- Proper systems and controls in place
- Legal compliance demonstrable
- Company assets protected
- Accounting records maintained automatically

### 5. Contract Law Principles

#### Relevant Principles

**Pacta Sunt Servanda** (Agreements Must Be Honored):
- If businesses agreed to use regima.zone and Shopify platforms
- Unilateral change by Rynette may be breach of contract
- Reversion to agreed system is appropriate remedy

**Good Faith and Fair Dealing**:
- All contracts include implied duty of good faith
- Hijacking revenue stream violates good faith
- Court can order restoration of good faith arrangement

**Breach of Fiduciary Duty**:
- If Rynette had fiduciary relationship with businesses
- Control and opacity may constitute breach
- Restoration of transparency is appropriate remedy

#### Application to Case

If the businesses operated for a decade with:
- Shared understanding of transparent operations
- Use of regima.zone domain (RegimA ownership)
- Shopify platforms with multi-user access
- Proper accounting and oversight

Then Rynette's unilateral change to:
- Opaque single-user control
- Suspect domain (Addarory ownership)
- No accounting integration
- No oversight

Constitutes breach of understanding/agreement and potentially breach of fiduciary duty.

### 6. Constitutional Principles

#### Constitutional Basis
**Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996**

**Section 34 - Access to Justice**:
- Right to fair hearing
- Requires evidence and records
- Opaque system prevents access to evidence
- Transparent system enables access to justice

**Section 14 - Privacy**:
- Right to privacy (balanced with POPIA)
- Personal information must be protected
- Personal PC storage inadequate
- Enterprise security protects privacy

**Section 9 - Equality**:
- Equal treatment before law
- Business owners have right to information about their businesses
- Opaque system denies equal access
- Transparent system provides equal access

### 7. Common Law Principles

#### Unjust Enrichment
If Rynette is:
- Controlling all revenue streams
- Providing no transparency or accountability
- Enriching herself at expense of rightful owners

Then unjust enrichment may apply:
- Rynette enriched (control of businesses)
- Owners impoverished (no access, no oversight)
- No legal basis for enrichment (hijacking)
- Restitution appropriate (return to transparent system)

#### Delict (Wrongful and Intentional Harm)
If Rynette's actions constitute:
- Wrongful conduct (violation of business owners' rights)
- Intentional or negligent conduct
- Causation (opaque system causes harm)
- Harm (financial, reputational, legal exposure)

Then damages and/or restoration order may be appropriate.

2. **ECTA**: Requires retention and protection of electronic data
3. **Consumer Protection Act**: Consumers have rights to information and records
4. **Companies Act**: Directors must maintain proper records and systems
5. **Contract Law**: Breach of understanding/agreement; restoration appropriate remedy

7. **Common Law**: Unjust enrichment and delict principles support relief

### Justification for Relief
