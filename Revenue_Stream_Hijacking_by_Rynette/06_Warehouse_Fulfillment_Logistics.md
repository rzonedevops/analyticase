def select_courier(order):
    # Business rules for courier selection
    
    # Rule 1: Customer selection (if customer chose specific courier)
    if order.customer_selected_courier:
        return order.customer_selected_courier
    
    # Rule 2: Destination-based
    if order.destination_country != "ZA":
        if order.shipping_speed == "express":
            return "DHL Express"
        else:
            return "Aramex"
    
    # Rule 3: Speed requirement
    if order.shipping_speed == "same_day":
        return "The Courier Guy Express"
    
    # Rule 4: Value-based (high-value items)
    if order.total_value > 5000:
        return "RAM Hand-to-Hand"
    
    # Rule 5: Weight and size
    if order.weight > 30:  # kg
        return "Dawn Wing Freight"
    
    # Rule 6: Cost optimization (default)
    # Calculate rates from all couriers and select cheapest
    rates = get_courier_rates(order)
    return select_cheapest_courier(rates)
```

1. Order ready for dispatch
2. Select courier based on rules
3. Call courier API with shipment details
4. Receive tracking number and label PDF
5. Print label at packing station
6. Affix label to package
7. Update Shopify with tracking number
8. Send tracking email to customer

## Transparency and Oversight

### Multi-Stakeholder Access

**Warehouse Manager**:
- Full visibility into all warehouse operations
- Performance metrics and staff productivity
- Inventory levels and movements
- Can view audit trail of all activities
- Cannot delete audit logs

**Operations Director**:
- High-level operational dashboards
- Fulfillment and shipping metrics
- Courier performance comparison
- Cost analysis
- Cannot post inventory adjustments directly

**Business Owner**:
- Operational metrics relevant to business performance
- Inventory value and turnover
- Fulfillment costs and efficiency
- Customer satisfaction metrics
- Independent verification of operations

**External Auditor** (time-limited):
- Read-only access to warehouse operations
- Audit trail review
- Inventory verification
- Process compliance review

**Key Principle**: Multiple stakeholders can independently verify operations; no single-person control

### Contrast with Current Opaque System

#### Current System (Rynette's Control)

**Deficiencies**:
1. **No WMS Integration**: Manual, error-prone fulfillment
2. **No Transparency**: Stakeholders cannot see inventory or operations
3. **No Audit Trail**: Cannot verify what was shipped, when, or to whom
4. **Single Person Control**: Only Rynette manages fulfillment
5. **Manual Processes**: High error rates, slow fulfillment
6. **No Performance Metrics**: Cannot measure or improve efficiency
7. **No Courier Integration**: Manual label creation, no tracking sync
8. **Personal Computer**: Fulfillment managed from personal device
9. **No Oversight**: No cross-checks or verification
10. **High Risk**: Inventory shrinkage undetectable, order errors unchecked

**Impact**:
- Slow order fulfillment
- High error rates
- Poor customer experience
- Inventory discrepancies
- Potential theft or loss undetectable
- No accountability

#### Proposed Integrated System

**Advantages**:
1. **Full WMS Integration**: Automated, accurate fulfillment
2. **Complete Transparency**: All stakeholders can monitor operations
3. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Every action logged and verifiable
4. **Multi-User Access**: Appropriate roles with oversight
5. **Automated Processes**: Fast, accurate, reliable
6. **Real-Time Metrics**: Continuous improvement possible
7. **Courier Integration**: Automated labels, tracking, notifications
8. **Enterprise Infrastructure**: Professional, scalable systems
9. **Multi-Level Oversight**: Cross-checks and accountability
10. **Low Risk**: Inventory control, error detection, audit evidence

**Impact**:
- Fast, efficient fulfillment
- High accuracy rates
- Excellent customer experience
- Accurate inventory management
- Fraud and theft prevention
- Full accountability and transparency

## Conclusion

The warehouse fulfillment and courier logistics integration provides:

1. **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes, faster fulfillment
2. **Accuracy**: Barcode scanning, verification, low error rates
3. **Transparency**: Multi-stakeholder visibility into operations
4. **Oversight**: Complete audit trails, accountability
5. **Customer Satisfaction**: Real-time tracking, accurate deliveries
6. **Cost Control**: Optimized courier selection, performance monitoring
7. **Scalability**: Enterprise systems can handle growth
8. **Professional Operations**: Best practices and industry standards

This integrated system represents the restoration of efficient, transparent warehouse and logistics operations that existed before Rynette's revenue stream hijacking.

The current opaque system, with no integration, no oversight, and single-person control from a personal computer, results in:
- Inefficient operations
- High error rates
- Poor customer experience
- No accountability
- Potential inventory shrinkage
- No stakeholder confidence

Court-ordered reinstatement of proper warehouse and logistics integration is essential for legitimate, efficient business operations.
