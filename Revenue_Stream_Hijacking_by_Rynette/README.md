# Revenue Stream Hijacking by Rynette - Case Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive documentation regarding the Revenue Stream Hijacking case involving Rynette. The primary objective is to demonstrate the viability and transparency of a POPIA-compliant Shopify Platform integrated with clear audit trails, secure communication systems, and proper oversight mechanisms.

## Case Background

The current situation involves a completely opaque system where only Rynette has visibility and control over all aspects of multiple businesses from her personal computer, with no oversight or cross-checks in place. This documentation aims to support the court-ordered reinstatement of the proper systems that were in operation for the past decade.

## Key Issues

1. **Lack of Transparency**: Current system is opaque with no oversight
2. **Single Point of Control**: All business aspects controlled by one individual on a personal computer
3. **No Audit Trails**: Absence of proper audit mechanisms
4. **Domain Ownership Concerns**: Use of suspect domain owned by Addarory (Rynette's son) instead of the legitimate regima.zone domain owned by RegimA
5. **System Hijacking**: Deviation from the healthy Shopify Platforms that operated successfully for a decade

## Relief Sought

The primary goal is to obtain a court order for:
- Rightful reinstatement of the system to its previous state
- Return of Shopify Platforms to the healthy situation prior to revenue stream hijacking
- Reinstatement of the regima.zone domain (owned by RegimA) instead of the suspect domain owned by Addarory
