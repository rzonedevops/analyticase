## Conclusion

The regima.zone domain has been the established business presence for approximately a decade, building customer trust, brand recognition, and operational infrastructure. Its replacement with a domain owned by a family member of the person who hijacked the revenue stream is highly suspicious and contrary to proper business practices.

The court is respectfully requested to order the immediate restoration of business operations to the regima.zone domain as part of the broader reinstatement of transparent, properly governed business systems with appropriate stakeholder oversight.
