    print(f"Relationship: {edge.relation_type.value}")
    print(f"Nodes: {edge.nodes}")
```

### Using Enhanced HyperGNN

```python
from models.hyper_gnn.hypergnn_model import HyperGNN

model = HyperGNN(input_dim=64, hidden_dim=32, num_layers=2)

# Get graph-level features
graph_features = model.compute_graph_features(hypergraph)
print(f"Mean pooling: {graph_features['mean_pooling']}")

# Enhanced link prediction

### Using Integration Enhancements

```python
from models.integration import LexADIntegration

# ... create hypergraphs ...

# Validate mappings
validation = integration.validate_mappings()
print(f"Bidirectional mappings: {validation['bidirectional_count']}")
print(f"Orphaned: {len(validation['orphaned_mappings'])}")

# Analyze temporal patterns
temporal_analysis = integration.analyze_temporal_sequences(events)
print(f"Avg time between events: {temporal_analysis['avg_time_between_events']}")
print(f"Common sequences: {temporal_analysis['common_sequences']}")

# Compute semantic similarity
similarity = integration.compute_semantic_similarity(
    "contract breach and damages",
    "breach of contract resulting in damages"

print(f"Similarity: {similarity}")
```
